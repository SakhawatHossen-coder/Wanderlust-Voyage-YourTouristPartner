                A: The ideal time depends on your preferences. Spring
                (April-May) and fall (September-October) offer pleasant
                temperatures and fewer crowds. Summer (June-August) is peak
                season with warm weather, but also comes with higher prices and
                larger crowds. Winter (December-February) offers festive charm
                in many cities and excellent conditions for winter sports.
